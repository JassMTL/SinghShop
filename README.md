Assignment 1 android

The emulator I would like you to use is Nexus 5X.
I made redundant methods. I went to deep before realizing that I could have shorten the code length.

This project revoles around a shopping application. It includes a main page, a menu page and a chekout page. The main page includes a title
(the name of my application), a description of the application (what it does) and a button that directs you to the menu page. The menu page
includes 3 parts.It includes a subtotal section which includes a label for the subtotal and the actual subtotal. The second part includes a
scroll view. That scroll view includes 3 cards that are almost identical. They have the same layout, but different products. The cards
include a title, the price, a plus button, a minus button, a count button, a subtotal label, a subtotal of that card and an image of the
product. The third section just includes a button to link it to the checkout page. The checkout page includes 3 label text vie for the
subtotal, GST, QST and a final price. It includes the value of those labels, a title saying "Checkout" and a thank you message. I used some
pictures from the internet for the products that I'm is displaying.
